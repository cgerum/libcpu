Implement preloading of dynamic linker address space 0x04000000:
-> prevent execution of mach_init etc. through fct. pointer by setting pointer to NULL 

Fix disassembly of some 68020+ instructions (according to OS X otool disassembler):

1.		56 C0              addq.? #0x00000003, d0
	should be:
		sne     d0
(fixed)

2.		DE FC 00 0C        adda.w #0xc, a7 
	should be:
		addaw   #0xc:w,sp
		subql   #0x1,d2

3.		2F 00              move.l d0, -(a7)
	should be:
		movel   d0,sp@- (post instead of preincrement?)

4.		0C AE 00 00 3F 54 FF FC cmpi.l #0x3f54fffc, 0x0(a6)
	should be:
		cmpl    #0x3f54,a6@(0xfffc:w)

5.		4C EE 04 0C FF F4  movem.l 0x40c(a6), d5 a4 a5 
	should be:
		moveml  a6@(0xfff4:w),d2/d3/a2

-> check for further problems...

Recognize exit of NeXT/68k program by call to libsys _exit():

		61 FF 04 FF E7 54  bsr (l50024B0);
		-> stop disassembly here?
