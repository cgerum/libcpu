BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

Ubuntu Linux
------------

CMake version 2.8 or higher is required. Unfortunately (as of January 3, 2010)
Ubuntu's default CMake is still at 2.6.x, so you'll have to build it yourself.

You can install other build dependencies with:

  sudo apt-get install flex bison libreadline-dev

To build libcpu:

  make


RUNNING SOME TESTS
==================

x86 front-end
-------------

To run the x86 front-end tests:

  ./test/scripts/8086.sh
